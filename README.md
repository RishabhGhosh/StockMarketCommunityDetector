Welcome to the Stock Market Community Detector (SMCD) repository! 

Our aim is to uncover and discern distinct communities within the stock market. By doing so, we can strategically align our trading decisions with these communities, leveraging their insights and knowledge. This approach allows us to make informed trading choices, increasing the likelihood of achieving profitable outcomes.

The project implements a Sentiment-Enriched Graphical Neural Network for analyzing the financial ecosystem and detecting stock market communities.

Understanding the dynamics of the stock market and the interactions among different stocks and market participants is crucial for making informed investment decisions. SMCD leverages Graphical Neural Networks (GNNs) and sentiment analysis to identify and analyze stock market communities, helping investors gain insights into market trends and sentiments.

The analysis and results presented in the associated paper can be reproduced by running the smcd.ipynb Jupyter notebook included in this repository.
